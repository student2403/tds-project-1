- **How the data was scraped:** I used the GitHub API to fetch users from Mumbai with over 50 followers, iterating through paginated results to collect user details and repositories, and then storing the data in CSV files.
  
- **Interesting finding:** Surprisingly, most top developers in Mumbai tend to contribute to open-source projects outside their full-time jobs, with several working at global companies but maintaining strong ties to local projects.
  
- **Recommendation for developers:** Developers should actively contribute to open-source repositories, as it helps build their public profile and attract followers, which can lead to better job opportunities and collaborations.
